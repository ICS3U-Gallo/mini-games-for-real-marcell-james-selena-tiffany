# mini-games-template
Each person in the group will be responsible for creating a completely different mini game based on the story or theme the group agrees upon. Each person needs to integrate the following topics into their mini game:

- Compound shapes
- Animation
- Drawing using a loop
- Use of lists

## Contributions
Every member MUST commit their changes to GitHub (perhaps in their own file) **every day**. 40% of the mark will be based on daily commits and proper commit messages. The other 60% will be inclusion of the above topics. You may use any resource available to you with the exception of copying another game from the Internet and having someone write your code for you.

Each member has their individual game, which are named: tiffany_game.py, Marcell-Game, selena_game.py, and James-Game. We have also combined all of our games into one file, named Circus_Adventure.py. 

## Storyline 
You get hired at a circus to perform some tricks! First, you must make you way into the circus tent by jumping on platforms. Then, as you get onto the stage, you realize that this place is more violent than you thought. You must pop some balloons while avoiding a big bomb as your first activity on the stage. Next, you must avoid getting hit by falling and rolling tires while moving across the stage to escape this dangerous circus. Your last task is to fly away from the circus while avoiding some pipes. Good luck!
